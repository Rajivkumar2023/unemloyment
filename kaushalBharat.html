  <h1>Kaushal Bharat Mission<a href="https://kaushalbharat.gov.in/">Kaushalbharat</a></h1><br>
  Kaushal Bharat Mission, also known as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), is a flagship program of the Indian government aimed at providing skill development training to the country's youth. The mission was launched on 15th July 2015 under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. <br><br>
  
  The key objectives of Kaushal Bharat Mission are as follows:<br><br>
  
  1. Skill Training: The mission aims to provide skill training to the youth of India to enhance their employability and make them job-ready. The training programs cover various sectors and industries to cater to diverse skill requirements.<br><br>
  
  2. Recognition of Prior Learning: The mission recognizes the skills acquired through informal learning or work experience and provides opportunities for individuals to undergo a formal assessment and certification process.<br><br>
  
  3. Mobilization and Counseling: It focuses on creating awareness and mobilizing potential candidates for skill development programs. It also provides career counseling and guidance to help individuals make informed choices about their skill development and career paths.<br><br>
  
  4. Industry Engagement: Kaushal Bharat Mission promotes active participation and engagement of industries and employers to align skill training with industry requirements. It encourages industry partnerships, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training to bridge the gap between skill supply and demand.<br><br>
  
  5. Placement and Entrepreneurship Support: The mission facilitates the placement of skilled candidates by collaborating with employers and industries. It also provides support and incentives for entrepreneurship and self-employment ventures.<br><br>
  
  The implementation of Kaushal Bharat Mission involves various training partners, including training centers, industry bodies, vocational training providers, and other organizations. Training programs under PMKVY are structured based on National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) standards and are delivered through approved training centers across India.<br><br>
  
  It's worth noting that the program may have undergone updates or modifications since my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend referring to official government sources or the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.<br><br>
